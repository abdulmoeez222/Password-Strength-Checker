Password Strength Checker
Overview
A Password Strength Checker is a web-based tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria, including length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides real-time feedback to users, displaying a progress bar and a message that indicates whether the password is "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong."

Features
Password Evaluation: Checks if the password meets certain security requirements (length, uppercase, lowercase, number, and special characters).
Progress Bar: A visual progress bar that fills as the password meets more strength criteria.
Character Requirements: Lists and colors requirements (green for met, red for unmet) to guide the user.
Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Colorful Feedback: Uses color (red, orange, green) to indicate password strength.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used to structure the content of the page.
CSS: Used to style the page and create a responsive, modern design.
JavaScript: Used to implement the password strength evaluation logic and update the UI dynamically.

Why Password Strength is Important
Strong passwords help protect users from various types of attacks, such as brute-force attacks, social engineering, and phishing. Password strength checkers ensure that users create secure passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to accounts and sensitive information.
